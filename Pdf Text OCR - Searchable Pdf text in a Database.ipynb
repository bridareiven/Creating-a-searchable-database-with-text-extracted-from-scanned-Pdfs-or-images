You may be confused as to how best prepare your data for machine learning, which algorithms to use or how to choose one model over another. In this guide you will discover a 14-part crash course into applied machine learning using the Weka platform without a single mathematical equation or line of programming code.  After completing this mini course:  e You will know how to work through a dataset end-to-end and deliver a set of predictions or a high performance model.  e You will know your way around the Weka machine learning workbench including how to explore algorithms and design controlled experiments.  e You will know how to create multiple views of your problem, evaluate multiple algorithms and use statistics to choose the best performing model for your own predictive modeling problems.  Let’s get started.  This is a long and useful guide. You might want to print it out.  Who Is This Mini-Course For?  Before we get started, let’s make sure you are in the right place. The list below provides some general guidelines as to who this course was designed for. Don’t panic if you don’t match these points exactly, you might just need to brush up in one area or another to keep up.  You are a developer that knows a little machine learning. This means you know about some of the basics of machine learning like cross-validation, some algorithms and the bias-variance trade-off. It does not mean that you are a machine learning PhD, just that you know the landmarks or know where to look them up.  This mini-course is not a textbook on machine learning. It will take you from a developer that knows a little machine learning to a developer who can use the Weka platform to work through a dataset from beginning to end and deliver a set of predictions or a high performance model.</td>\n",

Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.  3. Click the Classify tab.  The Test options pane lists the various different techniques that you can use to evaluate the performance of an algorithm.  e The gold standard is 10-fold Cross- Validation. This is selected by default. For a small dataset, the number of folds can be adjusted from 10 to 5 or even 3.  e If your dataset is very large and you want to evaluate algorithms quickly, you can use the Percentage split option. By default, this option will train on 66% of your dataset and use the remaining 34% to evaluate the performance of your model.  e Alternately, if you have a separate file containing a validation dataset, you can evaluate your model on that by selecting the Supplied test set option. Your model will be trained on the entire training dataset and evaluated on the separate dataset.  e Finally, you can evaluate the performance of your model on the whole training dataset.

A baseline result gives you a point of reference to know whether the results for a given algorithm are good or bad, and by how much. In this lesson you will learn about the ZeroR algorithm that you can use as a baseline for classification and regression algorithms.  1. Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer. 2. Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset. 3. Click the Classify tab. The ZeroR algorithm is chosen by default.  4. Click the Start button.  This will run the ZeroR algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation on your dataset. The ZeroR algorithm also called the Zero Rule is an algorithm that you can use to calculate a baseline of performance for all algorithms on your dataset. It is the worst result and any algorithm that shows a better performance has some skill on your problem.  On a classification algorithm, the ZeroR algorithm will always predict the most abundant category. If the dataset has an equal number of classes, it will predict the first category value. On the diabetes dataset, this results in a classification accuracy of 65%. For regression problems, the ZeroR algorithm will always predict the mean output value.  Experiment with the ZeroR algorithm on a range of different datasets. It is the algorithm you should always run first before all others to develop a baseline.  11</td>\n",

Right-click on the Result list click Load model and select your model file (diabetes- final.model).  2. Change the Test options to Supplied test set and choose data/diabetes.arff (this could be a new file for which you do not have predictions)  3. Click More options in the Test options and change Output predictions to Plain Text  4. Right click on the loaded model and choose Re-evaluate model on current test set.  The new predictions will now be listed in the Classifier output pane. Experiment saving different models and making predictions for entirely new datasets.  17</td>\n",

       "      <td>Final Word Before You Go...  You made it. Well done! Take a moment and look back at how far you have come:  e You discovered how to start and use the Weka Explorer and Weka Experiment Environment, perhaps for the first time.  e You loaded data, analyzed it and used data filters and feature selection to prepare data for modeling.  e You discovered a suite of machine learning algorithms and how to design controlled experiments to evaluate their performance.  Don’t make light of this, you have come a long way in a short amount of time. This is just  the beginning of your journey in applied machine learning with Weka. Keep practicing and developing your skills.  How Did You Go With The Mini-Course?  Did you enjoy this mini-course? Do you have any questions or sticking points?

       "4   Before We Get Started...  Machine learning is a fascinating study, but how do you actually use it on your own problems? You may be confused as to how best prepare your data for machine learning, which algorithms to use or how to choose one model over another. In this guide you will discover a 14-part crash course into applied machine learning using the Weka platform without a single mathematical equation or line of programming code.  After completing this mini course:  e You will know how to work through a dataset end-to-end and deliver a set of predictions or a high performance model.  e You will know your way around the Weka machine learning workbench including how to explore algorithms and design controlled experiments.  e You will know how to create multiple views of your problem, evaluate multiple algorithms and use statistics to choose the best performing model for your own predictive modeling problems.  Let’s get started.  This is a long and useful guide. You might want to print it out.  Who Is This Mini-Course For?  Before we get started, let’s make sure you are in the right place. The list below provides some general guidelines as to who this course was designed for. Don’t panic if you don’t match these points exactly, you might just need to brush up in one area or another to keep up.  You are a developer that knows a little machine learning. This means you know about some of the basics of machine learning like cross-validation, some algorithms and the bias-variance trade-off. It does not mean that you are a machine learning PhD, just that you know the landmarks or know where to look them up.  This mini-course is not a textbook on machine learning. It will take you from a developer that knows a little machine learning to a developer who can use the Weka platform to work through a dataset from beginning to end and deliver a set of predictions or a high performance model.   \n",

Each lesson was designed to take you about 30 minutes. You might finish some much sooner and for others you may choose to go deeper and spend more time. You can complete each part as quickly or as slowly as you like. A comfortable schedule may be to complete one lesson per day over a two week period. Highly recommended. The topics you will cover over the next 14 lessons are as follows:  Lesson 01  Lesson 02: Lesson 03: Lesson 04: Lesson 05: Lesson 06: Lesson 07: Lesson 08: Lesson 09: Lesson 10: Lesson 11: Lesson 12: Lesson 13:  Lesson 14:  Download and Install Weka.  Load Standard Machine Learning Datasets. Descriptive Stats and Visualization. Rescale Your Data.  Perform Feature Selection on Your Data. Machine Learning Algorithms in Weka. Estimate Model Performance.  Baseline Performance On Your Data. Classification Algorithms.  Regression Algorithms.  Ensemble Algorithms.  Compare the Performance of Algorithms.

Weka is free open source software. It is written in Java and can run on any platform that supports Java, including:  e Windows. e Mac OS X. e Linux.  You can download Weka as standalone software or as a version bundled with Java. If you do not already have Java installed on your system, I recommend downloading and installing a version bundled with Java.  1. Your task for this lesson is to visit the Weka download page’, download and install Weka on your workstation.     ‘http: //www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading. html  4   \n",

Weka is designed to load data in a native format called ARFF. It is a modified CSV format that includes additional information about the types of each attribute (column). Your Weka installation includes a subdirectory with a number of standard machine learning datasets in ARFF format ready for you to load. Weka also supports loading data from raw CSV files as well as a database and converts the data to ARFF as needed. In this lesson you will load a standard dataset in the Weka Explorer.  1. Start Weka (click on the bird icon), this will start the Weka GUI Chooser. 2. Click the Explorer button, this will open the Weka Explorer interface.  3. Click the Open file... button and navigate to the data/ directory in your Weka installation and load the diabetes.arff dataset.  Note, if you do not have a data/ directory in your Weka installation, or you cannot find it, download the .zip version of Weka from the Weka download webpage”, unzip it and access the data/ directory.  You have just loaded your first dataset in Weka. Try loading some of the other datasets in the data/ directory. Try downloading a raw CSV file from the UCI Machine Learning repository® and loading it in Weka.  *http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html 3http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/   \n",

In this lesson you are going to learn about the different ways to evaluate the performance of an algorithm in Weka.  1. Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer. 2. Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset.  3. Click the Classify tab.  The Test options pane lists the various different techniques that you can use to evaluate the performance of an algorithm.  e The gold standard is 10-fold Cross- Validation. This is selected by default. For a small dataset, the number of folds can be adjusted from 10 to 5 or even 3.  e If your dataset is very large and you want to evaluate algorithms quickly, you can use the Percentage split option. By default, this option will train on 66% of your dataset and use the remaining 34% to evaluate the performance of your model.  e Alternately, if you have a separate file containing a validation dataset, you can evaluate your model on that by selecting the Supplied test set option. Your model will be trained on the entire training dataset and evaluated on the separate dataset.  e Finally, you can evaluate the performance of your model on the whole training dataset. This is useful if you are more interested in a descriptive than a predictive model.  Click the Start button to run a given algorithm with your chosen test option.

A baseline result gives you a point of reference to know whether the results for a given algorithm are good or bad, and by how much. In this lesson you will learn about the ZeroR algorithm that you can use as a baseline for classification and regression algorithms.  1. Open the Weka GUI Chooser and then the Weka Explorer. 2. Load the data/diabetes.arff dataset. 3. Click the Classify tab. The ZeroR algorithm is chosen by default.  4. Click the Start button.  This will run the ZeroR algorithm using 10-fold cross-validation on your dataset. The ZeroR algorithm also called the Zero Rule is an algorithm that you can use to calculate a baseline of performance for all algorithms on your dataset. It is the worst result and any algorithm that shows a better performance has some skill on your problem.  On a classification algorithm, the ZeroR algorithm will always predict the most abundant category. If the dataset has an equal number of classes, it will predict the first category value. On the diabetes dataset, this results in a classification accuracy of 65%. For regression problems, the ZeroR algorithm will always predict the mean output value.  Experiment with the ZeroR algorithm on a range of different datasets. It is the algorithm you should always run first before all others to develop a baseline.  11   \n",

The Weka Experiment Environment allows you to design and execute controlled experiments with machine learning algorithms and then analyze the results. In this lesson you will design your first experiment in Weka and discover how to use the Weka Experiment Environment to compare the performance of machine learning algorithms.  1. Open the Weka Chooser GUI.  2. Click the Experimenter button to open the Weka Experiment Environment.  3. Click the New button.  4. Click the Add new... button in the Datasets pane and select data/diabetes.arff. 5. Click the Add new... button in the Algorithms pane and add ZeroR and IBk.  6. Click the Run tab and click the Start button.  7. Click the Analyse tab and click the Experiment button and then the Perform test button.  You just designed, executed and analysed the results of your first controlled experiment in Weka. You compared the ZeroR algorithm to the /Bk algorithm with default configuration on the diabetes dataset. The results show that JBk has a higher classification accuracy than ZeroR and that this difference is statistically significant (the little v character next to the result).  Expand the experiment and add more algorithms and rerun the experiment. Change the Test base on the Analyse tab to change which set of results is taken as the reference for comparison to the other results.  15   \n",

You cannot know how to best do this beforehand, therefore you must try out lots of different parameters. The Weka Experiment Environment allows you to design controlled experiments to compare the results of different algorithm parameters and whether the differences are statistically significant. In this lesson you are going to design an experiment to compare the parameters of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.  1. 2.  7. 8.  Open the Weka Chooser GUI.  Click the Ezperimenter button to open the Weka Experiment Environment  . Click the New button. . Click the Add new... button in the Datasets pane and select data/diabetes.arff. . Click the Add new... button in the Algorithms pane and add 3 copes of the [Bk algorithm.  . Click each [Bk algorithm in the list and click the Edit selected... button and change KNN  to 1, 3, 5 for each of the 3 different algorithms. Click the Run tab and click the Start button.  Click the Analyse tab and click the Experiment button and then the Perform test button.  You just designed, executed and analyzed the results of a controlled experiment to compare algorithm parameters. We can see that the results for large K values is better than the default of 1 and the difference is significant.
